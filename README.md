# CFP_Teaching_Portfolio
This is a Technology focused secondary Teaching Portfolio, containing an extensive self Audit of the Technology Mandatory curriculum based on the knowledge, skills and abilities of pre-service teacher, Caitlin Fitzgerald-Potter. Including a detailed description about myself, my philosophy and approach to teaching and learning along with a Professional learning plan. Developed learning resources and teaching plans have also been included for preview and download at users discretion.


Despite being text heavy and information-oriented, I [Caitlin Fitzgerald-Potter] have designed this website for both appeal and functionality, featuring a huge background image and scrolling effects (powered by Scrollex), responsive buttons and embedded hyperlinks for user engagement.
