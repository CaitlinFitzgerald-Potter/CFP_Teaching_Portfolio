								<h1>Teaching Approach</h1></header>
								<header class="minor">
									<p>My teaching philosophy cannot be distinguished solely by one approach but 
										rather a plethora of teaching strategies. I strive to ensure my teaching 
										practice is reflective of the deep and authentic world we are immersed 
										within in today's 21st Century. Utilizing current, highly practical, and 
										effective evidence-based pedagogical practices to engage, encourage and 
										engulf a passion, drive, and enthusiasm within my students. Reflective of 
										the immersive nature of the Stage 4 Technology Mandatory Curriculum. 
										Instilling a constructivist approach to teaching and learning, not only 
										provides students the opportunities to develop key skills required for 
										the workforce through a student-directed, discovery-based learning 
										approach (Vij, 2015). Ensuring the diverse needs of all students are 
										sufficiently met through the adaption and differentiation of both resources 
										and my teaching approach.  I aim to build a learning environment that is  
										safe, and inclusive and allows students to reach their full potential, 
										both personally and academically. (Karweit, N. 1998). Gaining the trust, 
										and honesty of my students through a positive 'student-teacher-relationship'. </p>

								<h4>Real-world Application</h4>
								<div class="image right"><img src="images/Figure1.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Making content meaningful, whether it be by connecting it to 
									a newly emerging trend, a popular show, or hobbies, assists 
									to become more engaged, interested, and participative in 
									classroom activities. An approach I believe helps immensely 
									with students' understanding, retention, and promotion of 
									independent learning and self-exploration.
									For example, taking in the art form displayed on ‘LEGO 
									MASTERS’, a year 8 'bridge; ergonomic and stability' class 
									was able to be created. Immersing students within a 
									hypothetical situation to craft and construct a model using 
									variety of tools and equipment.</p>
								
								
								<h4>Diversity and Differentiation</h4>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/Figure2.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Understanding that all students learn in different ways, at 
									different paces, and in different environments, supports the 
									creation and adaption of curricular content to one's learning 
									plans and sequences. For example, using and implementing a 
									plethora of multimodal forms throughout a lesson from textbooks 
									and interactive videos to hands-on games supports the needs of 
									‘visual, auditory, kinaesthetic learners and their physical, 
									social and intellectual development (​​VIC. 2007). Seeking to 
									create a learning environment that sees learning encouraged, 
									engaging, and valued for all students.</p>

								<h4>Assessment and feedback</h4>
								<p>Having the ability to observe and recognize within students when 
									tasks are above or below their skill level is vital to ensuring, 
									not only the learning of students but the safety of all. As TAS 
									teachers we expose students to a range of complex heavy duty 
									machinery that can be life threatening if used in the incorrect 
									manner. Therefore ensuring students are well equiped with the 
									knowledge and skills to use practical appliances is crucial in 
									order for them to adequately meet standards and complete 
									project-based assessments.</p>

								<h4>Communication</h4>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/Figure3.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Good communication is not only vital in the conveyance of theory 
									content within the classroom; in explaining key ideas, and 
									concepts. It is also imperative within workshops, to maintain a 
									strong clear voice and a persona for open communication. To 
									convey instructions from a clear explanation of safety rules, 
									and machine operating procedures to behavioral consequences. To 
									ensure the health and safety of all students.
								</p> <br>

								
								<br><h4>Behaviour Management</h4>
								<p>Not all students are going be enthusiastic, motivated or engaged in
									class to learn, however it is my role to ensure classroom rules, 
									and expectations are known from the commencement of class. For 
									example, no speaking whhen others are talking, taking the opinions 
									of others into consideration despite personal beliefs, and ensure 
									work is completed to best of ones ability.  Are all aimed at promoting 
									effective teaching and learning, and classroom safety. An approach 
									ensuring all students are given equal and just opportunities to thrive.</p>


								<h4>Confidence</h4>
								<div class="image right"><img src="images/Figure4.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Not every student has the same expsoure to various tools, equipment 
									and material. Thus it is imperative for me to not only be 
									equipped with knowledge and expertise in such areas, to guide 
									and instruct students through equipment usage and industry 
									practices to ensure health and safety is maintained but to have 
									[and display] confidence in personal capabilities to undertake a 
									variety of differnet projects.</p>
